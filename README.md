# weather_data

This is a python Script for getting the weather forecast for today and forecast for 5 days using data from https://openweathermap.org/.

You need an API key to obtain data. View the "How to start" guide at https://openweathermap.org/appid for more information. Getting an API key is free.

Replace 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' in the APIKEY variable with the key that you get.

## Python
Python 3 was used but it can easily be adapted to python 2.7.
If you do not have python installed, I recommend the anaconda python distribution. Download at https://www.continuum.io/downloads

## Modules to install
In terminal or cmd type in 
  pip install requests json pandas numpy

The above lets you install the modules required for the script to work.
